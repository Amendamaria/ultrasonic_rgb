# Obstacle Detection with Ultrasonic Sensor and RGB Lights
#### Overview
This project utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles within a certain range and indicates their proximity using RGB lights. The ultrasonic sensor emits sound waves and measures the time it takes for the waves to bounce back. Based on this time measurement, the distance to the obstacle is calculated. The RGB lights then change color based on the distance to provide visual feedback to the user.
#### Components
1. Arduino UNO
2. Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
3. RGB LED
4. Jumper wires
5. Breadboard (optional)
